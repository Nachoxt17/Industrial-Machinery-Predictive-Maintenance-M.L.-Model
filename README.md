This project builds a predictive maintenance model for industrial equipment using machine learning on time-series sensor data. The goal is to forecast potential machinery failures, minimize unplanned downtime, and improve operational reliability through data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Technologies Used:
- Python.
- Pandas.
- scikit-learn.
- Time Series Analysis.
- Jupyter Notebook.

## 📊 Project Highlights:
- Advanced feature engineering from raw time-series sensor data.
- Supervised machine learning model development, tuning, and evaluation.  
- Predictive insights on equipment failure risk and maintenance schedules.  
- Clear reporting of model performance and operational impact.

## 📂 Files:
- `predictive_maintenance.csv` — sensor dataset.
- `Industrial_Machinery_Predictive_Maintenance_ML_Model.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full pipeline.
